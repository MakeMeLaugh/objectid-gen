# objectid-gen

Simple cli tool for working with ObjectID 

# Features

* Generating ObjectID from current timestamp;
* Converting existing timestamp (in RFC3339 format) to ObjectID form (padded with zeros to the right);
* Generate ObjectID from relative point in time in the past (e.g. 1 hour 21 minutes and 42 seconds ago);
* Extracting timestamp from existing ObjectID string;

# Installation

For now, `objectid-gen` only available for installation as a Golang module:

```shell
go install gitlab.com/MakeMeLaugh/objectid-gen
```

If you want to install specific version of the tool just use `@v<version>`

You need to make sure that `$GOBIN` environment variable (usually it's `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is added to your `$PATH` environment variable.

Of course if you want to build it from source code yourself you are free to clone this repo or get it using Golang toolchain and build it manually:

```shell
$ go get gitlab.com/MakeMeLaugh/objectid-gen
$ cd objectid-gen && go build -o /your/desired/path/to/executables
```

Or download source code from [Releases](https://gitlab.com/MakeMeLaugh/objectid-gen/-/releases) page for a specific version.
Precompiled binary releases for Linux (amd64) and MacOS (arm64 and amd64) are also available under Releases page of this repo.

# Usage

```shell
Usage of objectid-gen:
  -V    Show version number and exit
  -a string
        String representation of time in the past to generate ObjectID from (valid time units are "s", "m", "h")
  -h    Show  this message and exit
  -o string
        ObjectID to parse and return as datetime (in RFC3339 format)
  -t string

```

# Examples

### Generate ObjectID from current timestamp

```shell
$ objectid-gen
6112e51d9357733c89798a85
```

### Extract timestamp from existing ObjectID

```shell
$ objectid-gen -o 6112e51d9357733c89798a85
2021-08-10T23:44:13+03:00
```

### Convert timestamp to ObjectID string

```shell
$ objectid-gen -t '2021-08-10T23:44:13+03:00'
6112e51d0000000000000000
```

* **Be aware**: timestamp string will be parsed as is: `2021-08-10T23:44:13+03:00` and `2021-08-10T23:44:13Z` will generate different ObjectID strings;
* due to ObjectID spec only first 8 characters represent time, so the string will be padded with zeros to the right;
   
### Generate ObjectID from a duration string

```shell
$ objectid-gen -a '13h29m42s'
611227830000000000000000
```

* "ns", "us" (or "Âµs") and "ms" time units are accepted but ignored due to ObjectID spec;
* due to ObjectID spec only first 8 characters represent time, so the string will be padded with zeros to the right;
